Version 1.8.0 has now been released and installed on all routegadget.co.uk sites. This release includes:

- Enhancements to the "Measure" function following use at HH Zoom meetings. Route nodes can be dragged to adjust them, overlays are only visible when dialog window is open, and "Delete all" button added.
- New manager function added to allow deletion of unused maps.#
- Enhancement to course sliders so that they handle relay and score courses better.
