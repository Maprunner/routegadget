After nearly two years of behind the scenes development and testing the new version has now been properly rolled out to all sites and moved to become the master branch in Github. Most people will already be familiar with this although there are a few more minor functional enhancements included as well.

For the technically minded the main changes behind the scenes are:

- Full rewrite of the front end sticking largely with vanilla javascript. I got as far as a working version in React but it just felt too complicated.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling and UI components. I looked at all sorts of other options but this turned out to be the most sensible.
- Build process migrated to use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), and hence [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), meaning that the whole build process is quicker and more robust.
- Integrated end to end testing using Cypress, including full coverage analysis of the front-end javascript: currently over 93% of statements and 85% of branches are covered.
