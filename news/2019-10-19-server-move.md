Routegadget UK was moved to a new server on 19th October 2019. Around half of current sites are now working correctly. This should include all clubs that have an event in the next two weeks, as well as the other heavily used sites. Unfortunately it may be another week before I can get the remaining sites working. This is because there is a limit on how fast I can generate the necessary security certificates. As part of this change I need to set up FTP access for anyone who had it. I'll try to do that early next week and let clubs know the new details. Sorry for the interruption in service.
