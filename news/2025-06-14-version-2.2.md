A day watching the Venla and Jukola relays has given me a chance to finalise and release a new version. The main changes are:

- New speed analysis functionality added to the performance analysis tabs.
- Purple dots added to GPS route displays to show nominal control locations based on elapsed time on the route.
- Improved presentation of Information panel (accessed via the Help icon). Georeferenced maps now incude a link to Open Street Map so that you can see exactly where a map is.
- Updated manager login functionality although this should be invisible to users.
- Updated start-up screen.
- Various other minor enhancements.
