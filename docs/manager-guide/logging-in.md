## Accessing manager functionality

![Login tab](/img/log-in.png)

You must be logged in to use the manager functionality.

The login page can be accessed by adding "?manage" to the normal web address

`http://www.club.routegadget.co/uk/rg2/?manage`

:::tip

There is also a link to the manager login in the information window.

## User name and password

When you first access the manager login for a new installation of Routegadget you will set up a new user name and password. Each of these must be at least five characters in length.

Only one user can be set up.

## Resetting the password

At present the only way to reset a password is by deleting the associated config file `rg2userinfo.txt` in the `kartat` directory on the server. 

You can do this via FTP, if you have an account, or by [contacting Simon](/about#contact-details).
