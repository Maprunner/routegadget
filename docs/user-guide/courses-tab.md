The Courses tab displays a list of all courses and shows the number of runners and the number of routes for each course.

The Courses tab is only enabled if you have an event loaded.

## Course details table

You can display each course using the first checkbox and all routes for the course using the second checkbox.

The final checkbox selects all routes for that course to be replayed.

The totals row at the bottom of the table allows you to show or hide all courses and all routes.

## Course sliders

For normal events (not score or relay) there is a slider bar for each course. This allows you to view only part of a course and route display and makes things much easier when analysing convoluted courses with a lot of crossovers.
