Routegadget provides several functions to allow you to analyse your run in detail.

## Performance analysis

### Displaying performance information

The analysis window can be displayed by clicking the Stats icon in the icon bar at the top of the screen. 

Double clicking on any runner in the Results table will bring up a detailed performance analysis for that runner.

### Summary

The Summary tab displays key aspects of the runner's performance.

![Performance information](../img/performance.png)

The Performance figure provides an indication of how the runner compares to others on the course. The higher the Performance the better the run. A value of 100% indicates that the runner is running at the same speed as the average of the top 25% of runners.

The Consistency figure provides an indication of how the runner's performance varied across each leg. The lower the figure the more consistent the run.

Performance and Consistency are based on a similar calculation used in [Winsplits](http://obasen.orientering.se/winsplits/default.aspx?lang=en).

### Performance chart

![Performance chart](../img/perf-chart.png)

The Performance chart on the Summary tab shows how the runner performed throughout the race. The solid red line shows position on each leg and the red dotted line shows average leg position across the whole race. The green bars show estimated time loss at each control.

:::tip
If your mouse is over the chart and you use the scroll wheel you can move through all the runners on that course.

The Splits tab includes full splits for all runners on the course, as well as performance, consitency and time loss estimation.

First, second and third split and cumulative times for each control are shown in blue, red and green text.

Splits with an estimated time loss of 20 seconds or over are highlighted with a pale red background.

### Time loss
