Routegadget provides several functions to allow you to analyse your run in detail.

## Performance analysis

### Displaying performance information
Double clicking on any runner in the Results table will bring up a detailed performance analysis for that runner.

:::tip
This function is only active for normal events, not score courses or relays.
:::

### Summary

The Summary tab lists key aspects of the runner's performance.

![Performance information](/img/performance.png)

The Performance figure provides an indication of how the runner compares to others on the course. The higher the Performance the better the run. A value of 100% indicates that the runner is running at the same speed as the average of the top 25% of runners.

The Consistency figure provides an indication of how the runner's performance varied across each leg. The lower the figure the more consistent the run.

Performance and Consistency are based on a similar calculation used in Winsplits.

### Splits

The Splits tab includes full splits for all runners on the course, as well as performance, consitency and time loss estimation.

First, second and third split and cumulative times for each control are shown in blue, red and green text.

Splits with an estimated time loss of 20 seconds or over are highlighted with a pale red background.



## Route choice measurement
